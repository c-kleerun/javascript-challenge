# javascript-challenge

This challenge creates code to dynamically create a table based on a given dataset. It will also allow users to filter the table data to help narrow down the information into useable amounts of data. This website is to be created using only JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.js per client request. This project currently includes a basic search form for date only.
